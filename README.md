Temperature Converter Program
Overview
The Temperature Converter Program is a C-based application designed to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. This program features a simple user interface that allows users to input a temperature value along with its current scale and then specify the scale to which they would like to convert it. The program calculates the equivalent temperature in the desired scale and displays the result with a precision of two decimal places.

Key Features:
Multiple Scale Conversion: Supports conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.
User-Friendly Input: Prompts the user for temperature input and scales, ensuring easy interaction.
Precise Output: Provides temperature results accurate to two decimal places, enhancing clarity and precision.
This program is a practical demonstration of using conditionals and arithmetic operations in C for real-world applications. It serves as an educational tool for understanding basic temperature conversion formulas and how to implement them programmatically.
